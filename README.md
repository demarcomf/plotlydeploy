# Belly Button Analysis....?

## Overview

This assignment was to weirdly analyze belly button bacteria and produce a dashboard that would be able to run through a large dataset of individuals who may or may not know what soap is...

Below you will see a customized dashboard that includes a few personal touches. I've included a rainbow gradient to really make this data about belly buttons pop. I have also put some contextual annotations beneath each chart to further explain what the data is intended to depict.
